# Death Race

![Game Preview](/public/img/game-preview.webp)

Multiplayer game where 1 sniper most spot and eliminate the real players amongst the crowd of NPCs

Sniper: Figure out who the real players are before the crowd reaches the finish line

Runners: Be first to the finish line while blending in with the NPCs

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Multiplayer

There are two forms of multiplayer, Room Play and normal multiplayer. 

- **Room Play**: The game is displayed on a single screen, allowing players in the same room to join using their phones and enjoy the traditional excitement together.
- **Normal Multiplayer**: Players can join remotely and use their own screens to participate in the game.

## Inspiration

Inspired by the Death Race game mode included in the Hidden in Plain Sight game. It does not support multiplayer outside local play so wanted to recreate it.
